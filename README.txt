This little quiz was made as a sort of mockery of those buzzfeed quizzes that used to be popular, and represents some of my earliest soirees into Python for class.
To run this, you will need all the files included in the repo, but will only need to run Final.py.
To do this from a command line on a Python compatible system, simply double-click Final.py (on Windows) or type "python Final.py" in the command line (in BASH.)
This project was made for school and is in no way representative of proper or effective practice using Python...but it's still kinda fun.
